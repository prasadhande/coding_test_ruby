## 2048-bonacci

## 2048 is a tiny video game that was super hype some years ago. You had to fuse two equal numbers to create its double. So 1 and 1 became 2, 2 and 2 became 4, and so on.


## Fibonacci was a famous mathematician who made the super-hype Fibonacci sequence you may have heard about: U(n+1) = U(n) + U(n-1). The first number of the sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …


## Let’s combine these two hype things to create a super-super-hype game!


## 2048-bonacci plays on a 4x4 square. Each square is either empty or contains a number of the Fibonacci sequence.


## You are given an initial board situation (a 2D array of integers) and a pushing direction (up, left, down, or right). Then, you must compute the board contents after the push and return an updated 2D array of integers.


## The value of integers in the array is guaranteed to be less than 2^16 and are all Fibonacci numbers. The value 0 means the square is empty.


## Rule 1

## Numbers move as far as possible in the pushing direction.


-------------                       -------------
| 2|  |  |  |                       |  |  |  |  |
-------------                       -------------
|  |  |13|  |                       |  |  |  |  |
-------------  => push downward =>  -------------
|  |  |  |  |                       | 2|  |  |  |
-------------                       -------------
| 5|  |  |  |                       | 5|  |13|  |
-------------                       -------------

Rule 2

When two consecutive numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are pushed one on another, they fuse into the next number.


-------------                       -------------
|  |  | 1| 2|                       |  |  |  | 3|
-------------                       -------------
| 1|  | 1|  |                       |  |  |  | 2|
-------------  => push rightward => -------------
|  | 8| 5|  |                       |  |  |  |13|
-------------                       -------------
|  | 5| 8|  |                       |  |  |  |13|
-------------                       -------------

Rule 3

Fusing orders are resolved in the backward direction of the push.


A fused number can not be fused once again in the same turn.


-------------                 -------------                 -------------
|  | 1| 2| 3|                 |  |  | 1| 5|                 |  |  | 1| 5|
-------------                 -------------                 -------------
|  | 3| 2| 1|                 |  |  | 3| 3|                 |  |  | 3| 3|
------------- => rightward => ------------- => rightward => -------------
|  |  |  |  |                 |  |  |  |  |                 |  |  |  |  |
-------------                 -------------                 -------------
|  | 5| 3| 5|                 |  |  | 5| 8|                 |  |  |  |13|
-------------                 -------------                 -------------

Rule 4

Numbers can move to a square that a fusing has just emptied.


-------------                     -------------
| 1|  |  |  |                     | 2|  |  |  |
-------------                     -------------
| 1|  |  |  |                     | 2|  |  |  |
-------------  => push upward =>  -------------
| 1|  |  |  |                     |  |  |  |  |
-------------                     -------------
| 1|  |  |  |                     |  |  |  |  |
-------------                     -------------

Let’s hype!
