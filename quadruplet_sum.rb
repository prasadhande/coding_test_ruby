Quadruplet sums

Implement a function which finds four numbers within the provided list which have a sum equal to the target.


An example is provided, but is too slow on larger testcases because it has too many nested loops.



There will always be at least one valid quadruplet.

The same number can be used any number of times.

Numbers can be returned in any order.


Example

numbers: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]


target: 11


One possible answer is [1, 2, 3, 5]. Another possible answer is [5, 5, 1, 0].
